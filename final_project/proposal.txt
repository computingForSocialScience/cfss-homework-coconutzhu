Licheng ZhuThe final project will be about a multiplex network analysis using my own data collected through a survey targeting environmental NGOs in China. So far, I’m still revising my proposal to obtain approval from IRB. Once it is finished, I expect the survey to acquire relational data about the support, information exchange, financial aid as well as project collaboration networks among Chinese environmental NGOs. The project will be a part of my master’s thesis, specifically emphasizing on visualization and will also involve data exploration. The purpose of the project is to prepare the collected data for further analysis, making it presentable and able to facilitate the future search for structural reasons (about why the networks are constructed this way). Because of time limitation in data collection, I may not be able to achieve an ideal ratio of returned survey by the end of this quarter. However, by this project, I wish to build a framework dealing with multiplex networks and test it while the sample size is still small. Hopefully by the end of 2014 academic year, I will be able to get adequate number of the surveys returned to me and run a complete analysis with changing minor proportion of the codes to reflect updated datasets. The computing power available is ideal for my thesis to analyze multiplex networks.In terms of execution, this project will be very similar with the undergraduate Facebook project, with exceptions that the relational data come from my own survey and multilayered networks will be involved (rather than an one-mode network). Thus I expect the procedures very close to what have been shown in the undergraduate Facebook project.
